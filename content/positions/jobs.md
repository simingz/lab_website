## <span style="color:green"> *We are actively hiring!* </span>
We seek highly motivated researchers to join our lab! Our lab offers a range of topics in cancer genomics and statisical genetics to work on. Thoughout my career, I am extremely forntunate and grateful for having incredible mentors along the way. Their mentorship has great impacts on me and I will try to offer what I have learned from them to my future trainees. Positions for students, postdocs and research assistants are available. Please see details below.

## Postdoc positions

We are mainly a computational lab deveping computational methods and perform analysis on genomic data, thus postdocs are required to have a quantitative background. Programming skills are necessary. Ideally, the postdoc should have experience in working with genomics data. Wet lab experience is a plus but not required. Postdocs in our lab will have the opportunity to work on projects that are of interests to both the PI and themselves. I will fully support the postdoc's research projects and career development. Informal inquiries are welcome. Please send me an email (siming.zhao@dartmouth.edu).

See more details about the postdoc job positions [here]().

## For graduate students

Students in the [Quantitative Biology Program](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/qbs/) are welcome to do rotations in our lab. Students are expected to work on genomics data and method development for genomics data. An interest in human genetics is higly valued. Please send me an email to discuss (siming.zhao@dartmouth.edu).

## Research assistant positions
Anyone who is interested in a research assistant position please contact me directly (siming.zhao@dartmouth.edu).
